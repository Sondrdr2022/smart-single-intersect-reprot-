  abstract = {The advent of the automobile revolution has led to various traffic congestion problems. The framework utilized for coordinating traffic isn't reliant on the ongoing situation of an intersection. This paper presents a system which handles traffic using Artificial Intelligence technique for adapting signal according to the density of traffic thereby automatically increasing or decreasing traffic signal time using Experience Replay mechanism.}
